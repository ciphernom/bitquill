# BitQuill - Digital Observer Protocol Editor

## What is BitQuill?
BitQuill acts as a digital observer that watches over your shoulder as you write, creating cryptographic proof of your writing process. Just as a trusted human observer could verify they watched you write something word by word, making natural pauses and corrections, BitQuill creates technical evidence of your authentic writing process.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (Using Pre-built Distribution)
1. Visit https://github.com/ciphernom/bitquill/
2. Download the latest release from the dist/ directory
3. Serve the directory using a local web server. For example:
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python -m http.server --directory dist/

   # Or using Node.js
   npx serve dist/

   # Or using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000 -t dist/
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or whatever port your server uses)

### Building from Source
Prerequisites:
- Rust and Cargo (https://rustup.rs/)
- Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/)
- wasm-pack (`cargo install wasm-pack`)

Building:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ciphernom/bitquill/
cd bitquill

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
wasm-pack build
npm run build

# Serve the dist directory:
npm run serve   # This will start a server on http://localhost:8080

# Or use any other web server of your choice:
python -m http.server --directory dist/
npx serve dist/
php -S localhost:8000 -t dist/
```

## The Problem
In an era of AI-generated content, there's no reliable way to prove that a human actually wrote something. While traditional timestamps can show when a document was saved, they can't prove how it was written. It's like having a security camera that only takes a photo every hour instead of recording continuous footage.

## How BitQuill Solves It
BitQuill acts as a continuous observer of your writing process, creating verifiable proof that a human sat down and wrote the content keystroke by keystroke. Like a trusted witness watching over your shoulder, it:

1. **Observes Every Keystroke**: Records each character typed, backspace pressed, and pause taken, just as a human observer would see.

2. **Creates Tamper-Proof Evidence**: Uses Merkle trees to create an unalterable chain of evidence of your writing process, like a witness taking detailed notes that can't be modified later.

3. **Verifies Human Patterns**: Analyzes typing rhythms, pauses, and corrections that are characteristic of human writing, similar to how an observer would notice natural writing behavior.

4. **Prevents Automated Writing**: Uses proof-of-work to ensure content couldn't have been generated instantly, just as a human observer would know if you suddenly pasted in pre-written text.

5. **Timestamps Key Moments**: Regularly anchors the writing session to blockchain timestamps, like having the observer periodically sign and date their notes.

## Key Features
- **Continuous Observation**: Monitors and validates the writing process in real-time
- **Formatting Preservation**: Keeps track of styling and formatting changes as part of the proof
- **Verifiable Export**: Allows you to share your work with proof of how it was written
- **Tamper-Evident**: Any attempt to modify the writing history is detectable
- **Privacy-Focused**: Like a confidential observer, verifies your process without revealing your content

## Technical Implementation
BitQuill implements its digital observer using:
- WebAssembly for high-performance cryptographic operations
- Quill.js for rich text editing capabilities
- SHA-256 for hash generation
- Merkle trees for maintaining edit history
- OpenTimestamps for blockchain anchoring
- Edit pattern analysis for human behavior verification

## Known Issues
- Formatting doesn't show up in the editor. It does get saved in the serialization but it just doesn't appear in the editor. A solution is being worked on.

## Future Applications
- Academic integrity verification
- Professional writing portfolios
- Content marketplace verification
- Journalism source verification
- Creative writing authentication

## License
GPL-3.0-or-later

## Contributing
We welcome contributions that enhance the protocol's ability to verify human authorship while maintaining usability for writers.

---
BitQuill serves as your trusted digital observer, creating indisputable proof that you genuinely wrote your content, one keystroke at a time.
