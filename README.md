# BitQuill - Digital Observer Protocol Editor

## Purpose
BitQuill is a specialized text editor designed to provide writers with cryptographic proof of their writing process and effort. In an era where AI-generated content is becoming increasingly prevalent, BitQuill enables authors to demonstrate their authentic human writing process through a combination of technical measures.

## The Problem
With the rise of AI content generation, there's a growing challenge in distinguishing between human-written and machine-generated content. Traditional timestamping or version control systems only show when content was saved, not how it was created. This makes it difficult for human authors to prove their creative process and effort.

## How BitQuill Solves It
BitQuill creates a verifiable record of the writing process by:

1. **Delta-Based Recording**: Captures every keystroke, edit, and pause in the writing process, preserving the natural rhythm and flow of human writing.

2. **Merkle Tree Implementation**: Creates a cryptographic chain of evidence for the entire writing session, making it impossible to retroactively alter the writing history.

3. **Edit Pattern Analysis**: Monitors typing patterns, pauses, and corrections that are characteristic of human writing behavior.

4. **Proof of Work**: Implements a dynamic difficulty system that requires computational work for each edit, preventing rapid automated content generation.

5. **Timestamping**: Integrates with the OpenTimestamps protocol to provide blockchain-anchored proof of when content was written.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Verification**: Continuously validates the authenticity of the writing process
- **Formatting Preservation**: Maintains rich text formatting while ensuring cryptographic integrity
- **Export Capabilities**: Allows authors to save and share their work with complete proof of authorship
- **Tamper-Evident**: Any attempt to modify the writing history will be detected
- **Privacy-Focused**: All verification happens locally; no content needs to be uploaded

## Benefits

- **For Authors**: Provide credible proof of their writing effort and process
- **For Publishers**: Verify the authenticity of submitted content
- **For Readers**: Trust that content was genuinely human-written
- **For Platforms**: Implement verifiable standards for human-generated content

## Technical Implementation

BitQuill uses a combination of:
- WebAssembly for high-performance cryptographic operations
- Quill.js for rich text editing capabilities
- SHA-256 for hash generation
- Merkle trees for maintaining edit history
- OpenTimestamps for blockchain anchoring
- Edit pattern analysis for human behavior verification

## BUGS!
- formatting doesn't show up in the editor. It does get saved in the serialisation but it just doesn't appear in the editor. Im working on a solution to this.

## Future Applications

- Academic integrity verification
- Professional writing portfolios
- Content marketplace verification
- Journalism source verification
- Creative writing authentication

## License
GPL-3.0-or-later

## Contributing
We welcome contributions that enhance the protocol's ability to verify human authorship while maintaining usability for writers.

BitQuill represents a step toward preserving the value and verifiability of human creative effort in an age of automated content generation. By providing cryptographic proof of the writing process, it helps authors demonstrate their authentic contribution to the written word.
